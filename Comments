I really like the layout of the homepage of Frederick. It is well organized, smooth and informative. 
In addition, I like the way Frederick implemented JS into his webpage. The idea of having a magic tab 
which could change the backgroundof the home page is really briliant. 

In terms of the code, Frederick do a very good job to organzie the code and therefore the code is highly mantainable. 

Very enjoy this homepage of Frederick.
